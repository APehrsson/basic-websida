    <h1>Let's see who won!</h1>
    <ul>
    
      <li>False! Andreas has never been a chess prodigy. In fact, he once tried to move the queen like a knight. Checkmate!</li>
    
      <li>Not even close! Andreas and his wife checked their family trees and found no branches connecting them. They're more like distant high-fivers than relatives.</li>
    
      <li>Nah, that's just a fluffy lie. The only record Andreas holds is for the most marshmallow fluff stuck to his face after attempting the challenge.</li>
    
      <li>Well, he's fluent in a universal language called "Andreasese," but unfortunately, it doesn't stretch further than that, Swedish and English.</li>
    
      <li>False alarm! Andreas has never visited China, but if he ever does, he promises a video of him moonwalking on the Great Wall. Until then, it's just a dream.</li>
    
      <li>Nope, he's more into post-it notes than post stamps. His collection is filled with doodles and reminders to buy more post stamps, though.</li>
    
      <li>Ullared's hot dog vendors can rest easy. Andreas has never won a hot dog eating contest. He did, however, win the "Most Creative Use of Ketchup" award once.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately Andreas did drop something on his desert rat "Piff", who didnÂ´t make it. Childhood trauma.<br>
      Number 6 is the correct answer. </li>
    </ul>
